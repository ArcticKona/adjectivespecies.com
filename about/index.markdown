Furry could be said to be a lot of things, but above all, it's a collection of people.  People, with all of their differences and similarities, their overlapping sub-societies, their petty arguments and tangled relationships.  The goal at [adjective][species] as a metafurry resource is to take a look at that from the inside (and maybe occasionally from the outside) and explore this jumble of a fandom.

The name [adjective][species] is a synecdoche, a way of expressing the whole of our weirdness through a smaller part of it.  Our mascot is, accordingly, RandomWolf, rendered accurately in the banner by [Floe](http://www.furaffinity.net/user/floe).

If you are interested in contacting us, please feel free to leave a comment, catch us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/adjspecies), or shoot us an email at [submit@adjectivespecies.com](mailto:submit@adjectivespecies.com)!  [adjective][species] is governed by the [[a][s] Code of Conduct](http://www.adjectivespecies.com/code-of-conduct/).
