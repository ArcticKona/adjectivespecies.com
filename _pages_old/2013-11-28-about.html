<p>Furry could be said to be a lot of things, but above all, it's a collection of people.  People, with all of their differences and similarities, their overlapping sub-societies, their petty arguments and tangled relationships.  The goal at [adjective][species] as a metafurry resource is to take a look at that from the inside (and maybe occasionally from the outside) and explore this jumble of a fandom.</p>
<p>The name [adjective][species] is a synecdoche, a way of expressing the whole of our weirdness through a smaller part of it.  Our mascot is, accordingly, RandomWolf, rendered accurately in the banner by <a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/user/floe" target="_blank">Floe</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in contacting us, please feel free to leave a comment, catch us on <a href="http://twitter.com/adjspecies">Twitter</a>, or shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:submit@adjectivespecies.com">submit@adjectivespecies.com</a>!  [adjective][species] is governed by the <a href="http://www.adjectivespecies.com/code-of-conduct/">[a][s] Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
