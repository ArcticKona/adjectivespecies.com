<p>[a][s] contributors make the occasional appearance and presentation at conventions around the world (well, okay, a few cons in the US plus Confuzzled in the UK), and Further Confusion is one of our regulars! This year, [a][s] folks have a few panels at FC2017, so if any catch your eye, stop on by and say hi!</p>
<p><em>Note that times/dates are tentative until scheduling gets locked in by con staff. Bookmark this page and we'll keep it up to date with any changes. Data was snagged from the panel system directly, but if I missed any [a][s] contributors' panels, shoot me an email or leave a comment!</em></p>
