<p>Over the last few weeks, I've had a lot of good conversations about [a][s], what it means, and how best to engage with it.</p>
<p>A lot of those conversations boil down to one core topic, and that topic falls out into one lesson. That is, [a][s] provides what many feel is an important resource. There is a wealth of data, a wealth of ideas, and probably at least three more articles on gender Makyo can write (ohoho...just you wait until tomorrow!). The lesson that comes out of this is that the project should never - indeed, few projects <em>should</em> ever - continue out of a sense of obligation.</p>
<p>Our esteemed <a href="https://www.adjectivespecies.com/author/rabbit/">Phil Geusz</a> wrote me privately to share his thoughts on this, and brought up some very good points about what goes into running a project. It takes time, steady effort, and dedication. None of what I said two weeks ago is negated: I need to find a healthy level with which to engage (something that falls squarely on my shoulders), and I will gladly accept all the help I can get. Additionally, it could be that the site does need change: the articles and data, through the poll, form a core part of the project, but our voice and scope ought to be continually evaluated.</p>
<p>So let's keep going. We have more than 41,000 responses to the Furry Poll to plow through and, as my work on tomorrow's post shows, far more data than shows up when we just search for longitudinal responses, as we have in the past. When you add in the fact that the IARP also has <a href="http://www.furryresearch.org/research-and-findings/">a wealth of data</a>, we have our work cut out for us. Plus, furry remains delightfully weird, so we'll have no shortage of thinkpieces and longreads to toss out there.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your tireless patience, and if you have an idea for an article you'd like to pitch, do remember that <a href="http://www.adjectivespecies.com/contributing">our submissions are always open</a>.</p>
