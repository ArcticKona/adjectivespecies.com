<p>There are a lot of writers within the fandom. By our estimates, something like 40% of furries consider themselves writers of a sort. That can mean a lot of things, of course. It could mean that the writer is someone who spends a lot of time writing stories and novels, or it could mean someone who writes one or two non-fiction articles a year for a website with a random wolf mascot.</p>
<p>Either way, there's a lot of words out there, which can be attested to by the number of furry and furry-friendly publishing houses that have cropped up. One of those houses is Thurston Howl Publications, with whom I work as an editor. The thing that got me interested in working with THP was its anthologyÂ <em>Furries Among Us</em>. The first book was an excellent collection of essays on furry - what made it up, what furries did, who was a furry, and so on.</p>
<p>Howl invited me to participate in the second volume, so I had the chance to write a longer article than I normally do. It involves data and gender, to absolutely no one's surprise ever.</p>
<p>Well, that second volume <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1945247118/?ref_=aga_h_cl_dashboard_pl">just came out</a>! You can find it on Amazon for the wallet-friendly price of $7.99.</p>
<p>In a shameless attempt to boost furry non-fiction within and around the fandom, [a][s] is happy to offer a giveaway! Keep an eye on <a href="https://twitter.com/adjspecies">our twitter</a> for the link - there will be ten copies up for grabs, first come, first serve. Note that the link is only applicable for the continental US - Amazon's restriction, not ours, alas.</p>
<p>While you're at it, check out Thurston Howl Publications <a href="http://thurstonhowlpublications.com">on the web</a> and on <a href="https://twitter.com/thurstonhowlpub">twitter</a>.</p>
