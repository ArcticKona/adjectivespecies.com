<p>As in the past, we've worked with the International Anthropomorphic Research Project, and we occasionally receive news of a survey or study they or related researchers are conducting.</p>
<p>The following comes from Moses Simpson</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm a Masters student from the University of Waikato and I'm doing research into the mental health and protective factors of the furry community.</p>
<p>This research draws from work done by the IARP and adds an investigation into how being within the furry community can be a predictor factor for or protective factor against mental health issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>The survey is well-designed and understanding of the basics of the furry subculture and of mental health. And, hey, you could win an Amazon voucher for taking the survey! Sweet.</p>
