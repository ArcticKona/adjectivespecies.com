<p>A quick plug: this year at Confuzzled, I'm running a Furry Hypnotism show.</p>
<p>In what I think is a first at a furry convention anywhere, I'll be running a group hypnosis session followed by some furry-themed fun &amp; games. The group hypnosis session will be a relaxed and vivid experience, helping you get in close touch with your furry self. And then onto hilarious party games.</p>
<p>I'm on the main stage at 3:30pm on Saturday afternoon for 90 minutes or so. It's going to be thoughtful and fun: happiness guaranteed.</p>
<p>Confuzzled 2012 (<a href="http://www.confuzzled.org.uk/premiere/">www.confuzzled.org.uk</a>) is held inÂ Hinckley, Leicestershire, from 25 to 28 May. There are over 600 registered attendees.</p>
<p>I'll be about for the rest of the convention with some [adjective][species] goodies. I'm friendly and shouldn't be too hard to track down, so please say hello if you see me trotting about the halls.</p>
