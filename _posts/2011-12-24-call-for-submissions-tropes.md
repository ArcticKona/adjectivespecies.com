<p>Hey!  You!  Are you a furry writer?  Or an avid reader of furry fiction?  Yeah?  Well, we want <strong>you</strong>!</p>
<p>We've been spending a good amount of time on visual art, recently, and as we peek through the drafts and ideas for the upcoming year's articles, there's still plenty more where that came from!  We'd like to start branching out, however.  In order to get a broader perspective on the furry writing scene, we're trying something new: we'd like to feature three short pieces about tropes in furry fiction.  A trope is an idea, technique, or metaphor that carries through multiple, unconnected works; as <a href="http://tvtropes.org" target="_blank">TVTrope</a>s puts it: "Tropes are devices and conventions that a writer can reasonably rely on as being present in the audience members' minds and expectations".  We're looking to explore a few of these which are either specific to furry writing, or weirdly out of proportion in our genre.  Keep reading for the rules!</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>The Rules</h2>
<p>We're looking to pick three entries from three different people in order to highlight some of the tropes common in furry writing.  You may point these tropes out in a humorous fashion, find a unique way to hang a lampshade on them, to subvert, avert, or invert them, or point out if they are particularly effective.  Three winners will be published here as an entry with proper credit, links back to galleries or websites, and a sentence about the author.</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter as many times as you want; if you provide more than one entry in a submission, please make sure they're easily distinguished.</li>
<li>Submissions should be 500-1000 words.</li>
<li>Please include a short sentence about yourself and/or your character, as well as a link if you wish (website, FA or SoFurry gallery, etc).</li>
<li>Cite any quotes you include.</li>
<li>If your submission is fiction, please provide a description of the trope you are highlighting in order to make sorting easier (we're aiming for three <em>different</em> tropes).</li>
</ul>
<div>Please email your submissions to <a href="mailto:submit@adjectivespecies.com">submit@adjectivespecies.com</a> by <strong>12:00 AM, Mountain Time,</strong> <strong>Tuesday, January 31, 2012</strong>.</div>
<h2>Fine print</h2>
<p>You will be notified in advance whether or not your entry is selected.  Only one entry will be selected per person.  By entering, you're giving us the right to publish your entry here on http://www.adjectivespecies.com with proper attribution.  You may be contacted again if there are additional publishing opportunities for your entry (we will never spam, nor share your address, of course).  We may edit your entry for style, spelling, and grammar, and will notify you in advance if we do so.  If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:submit@adjectivespecies.com">submit@adjectivespecies.com</a>.</p>
