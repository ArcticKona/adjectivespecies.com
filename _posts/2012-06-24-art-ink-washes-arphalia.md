<p>It was suggested by a few folks that it would be good to do a semi-regular feature on some of the wonderful art that may not follow the norm of what’s posted out there.  For this post, we’ll be taking a look at <a href="http://furaffinity.net/user/arphalia" target="_blank">Arphalia</a> and her work with ink washes.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The ink washes are something I used to do ages ago before I got into the fandom. (I got into the fandom "officially" around 1997 or so but was aware that something called furries existed a few years previous but didn't have any access to check into the whole scene since I wasn't online yet.) I had marker phases, ink pen inking phases and a huge (and ongoing) colored pencil phase. Returning to ink wash and watercolor again still feels like a New Thing even while its not."</p></blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_768" style="float: center" width="300"><a href="http://www.adjectivespecies.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-768" title="Three Happy Orcas by Arphalia" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2-300x147.jpg" width="300" height="147" /></a><figcaption> <em>Three Happy Orcas</em> by Arphalia</figcaption></figure>
<p>The contrast provided in these simple, monochromatic (or mostly so, as in the case of the center image above) is part of their draw: in many cases, the subject is actually lighter than the background.</p>

<p>They are not simply images on a page, but images on a texture.</p>
