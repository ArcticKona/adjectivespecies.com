<div class="m_7712795104322649404_1mf m_7712795104322649404_1mj">If you've got some time and you're interested in helping out with furry science, come take the International Anthropomorphic Research Project's newest, international FurScience survey! They've been doing these for years now, and we use the data to help the fandom and those outside the fandom learn more about furries!</div>
<div></div>
<div class="m_7712795104322649404_1mf m_7712795104322649404_1mj">Feel free to spread the word about it to other furries you know - they're trying to make this our biggest and most representative sample of furries ever.</div>

<div>For those curious about the Furry Poll, that will return in 2018, split up into portions that can be completed at your convenience. It got far too long and a pain to complete, so we're doing all we can to help that.</div>
