<p>Alright, folks!  With the start of a new year, we're featuring a new addition to the site: a census and survey of the furry community!  We've pulled together a few demographic questions similar to the Furry Survey for consistency's sake, plus some additional information about characters.  In addition to the census, we've also collected a few long-answer survey questions driven in part by the content of the site.  The information collected by the survey will, in turn, help steer the direction of the content.  This is your chance to help explain some of how you feel about your membership in this crazy fandom!</p>
<p>Check it out here: <a href="http://survey.adjectivespecies.com/2012/">http://survey.adjectivespecies.com/2012/</a></p>

<h2>Anonymity</h2>
<p>The survey is structured so that you make take it completely anonymously if you desire. While the information may drive the content of the site, your answers will never be referenced directly if you choose to remain anonymous.  However, if you are okay having your answers referenced or quoted in the site content, then you will have the option to provide a name or pseudonym, which will be used to attribute your answers back to you.  The information is collected in such a way that, if you desire to remain anonymous, there really is no way we can tie your survey responses back to you!</p>
<h2>Survey code and pass code</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the survey, you will have the option to either enter a survey/pass code combo, or proceed without.  If you have received a paper copy of the survey (we're aiming to be able to give this survey out at conventions - we're still waiting on a response from the Further Confusion board), there will be a code pair at the top of the survey: this is how we will key in your results, or, if you kept your survey, how you may key in your own results.  If you do not have a code pair, however, you may still take the survey by choosing to begin without codes.  This will generate a code pair for you and provide it on the next page of the survey.  <strong>Note: </strong>in order to have your survey responses properly attributed to you if you wish to allow us to quote them, you must enter in your survey code in the provided field here.  During the survey, you may choose which name you would like to be referred to by if at all!  Again, entering the code on this page is the only way in which we will be able to tie your identifying information to your survey responses - you may take the survey anonymously by simply not entering your code here!</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments on the survey, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:survey@adjectivespecies.com">survey@adjectivespecies.com</a> or through comments on this post - we will update this with any additional information that's requested.</p>
