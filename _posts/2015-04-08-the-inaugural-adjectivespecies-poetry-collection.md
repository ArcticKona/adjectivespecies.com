<p>It’s here, it’s finally here! It’s been a month in the works, but the inaugural <i>[adjective][species]</i> Poetry Collection is here. It’s been a lot of fun reading and putting together this set of amazing poems, getting to see the breadth of talent in the fandom. I know, as a poet myself, it’s sometimes difficult to sell your talent as as meaningful. I’ve had so many people, in-fandom and not, just raise eyebrows at the mere idea of poetry, so I’m glad so many people still write it.</p>
<p>I’m not here to set this post up too much. The poems are organized by flow, not by any ranking system. There is no winner—just a curated experience. Thank you to all the poets who submitted poems, and hopefully we can do this again soon.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why a Weasel</span> by <a title="George Squares" href="https://twitter.com/georgesquares" target="_blank">George Squares</a></p>
<p>Because I’ve power when a lump of sadness sits in my chest,<br />
and the feeling is utterly mine.<br />
Quite the covetous catch with this feeling I snatch<br />
from myself like the robin’s high treasure in nest.</p>
<p>I command hurting hunches to bunches<br />
of bristles, and pine thistles, and mountain peak priories,<br />
where dead clerics dance and damned fairies prance<br />
in the carvings of soft-whittled wood.</p>
<p>The colors blind, barely, when fairly I flip<br />
to the conclusion on the tip of my tongue—<br />
though there in my throat it has clung<br />
when you told me my voice was deeper than you thought.</p>
<p>But there’s many ways to squeak, and to hide, and to peek,<br />
peek at you, yes at you, with my stare always blatant.<br />
When night bleeds bland ink and in the earth, on your brink,<br />
“things must get better,” you moan, and I wink. And I think.</p>
<p>How sad you can’t see me at home past the stack,<br />
in the black. Keeping track.<br />
When I write out my anguish it breaks. Snicker-snack.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At the Aquarium</span> by <a title="Renee Carter Hall" href="https://www.weasyl.com/~poetigress" target="_blank">Renee Carter Hall</a></p>
<p>The otters, all brothers,<br />
curve and glide through the pool,<br />
pushing off against the thick glass<br />
and diving long and deep.<br />
One plays a game with a sinking stone,</p>
<p>nosing it, batting it to keep it off the bottom,<br />
as one might blow on a falling leaf.<br />
The trainer finishes her talk and<br />
calls for questions.<br />
Little girl in the audience:</p>
<p><i>Why do they play with rocks?</i></p>
<p>Two answers come to mind—the scientific first,<br />
describing how such a game would keep their skills honed,<br />
thus helping them catch more fish, live longer, reproduce,<br />
pass on their genes, ensure the species' survival.<br />
But the second answer feels more like truth:</p>
<p>that there is joy, however simple, in the feeling<br />
of every muscle working in turn, rudder of tail,<br />
dexterous webbed paws, all responding perfectly<br />
in the sweet resistance of water.<br />
No purpose served but in the act itself—<br />
the satisfaction of the well-played game,<br />
the image in sand, the completed poem.</p>
<p><i>Why do they play with rocks?<br />
</i>The trainer fumbles for an answer,<br />
then admits she doesn't know.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shape-changed Heart</span> by <a title="Amy Fontaine" href="http://www.northcoastjournal.com/humboldt/ArticleArchives?author=2125503" target="_blank">Amy Fontaine</a></p>
<p>You need not feel sorry for me<br />
because I have dreams.<br />
My mind harbors a multiplicity of faces,<br />
of voices:<br />
a flock, a pack, a pride.</p>
<p>It’s not a curse.<br />
I’m not diseased.<br />
I think it’s more like a superpower:</p>
<p>the ultimate Empath,<br />
animal shaman,<br />
able to shift into<br />
all creatures under the sun.</p>
<p>I’ve found friends who understand<br />
what it means to walk in two worlds.<br />
To don one skin by day,<br />
by night another,<br />
to sing the praises<br />
of the full-bellied moon.<br />
Perhaps we are the lucky ones:</p>
<p>better to be a furred vagabond,<br />
a roving Rover,<br />
the owner of a shaggy,<br />
shape-changed heart</p>
<p>than a listless tool<br />
without a story to tell.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wolf Break</span> by <a title="Huskyteer" href="http://huskyteer.co.uk/bibliography.php" target="_blank">Huskyteer</a></p>
<p>Eleven o'clock; coffee time.<br />
I opened a pack of wolves.<br />
Fur white as icing, they surged<br />
through the office, staring and sniffing<br />
with almond eyes and chocolate noses.<br />
Flicking the crisp points of their ears,<br />
they crunched across keyboards<br />
dunked their paws in tea mugs<br />
snapped gingerly at power cords.<br />
Then, at the call of distant snows,<br />
they took the lift and left, behind them just<br />
a sugar dust of hair on carpet tile.<br />
Next time I'll get custard creams.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procyon Prowling</span> by <a title="Altivo Overo" href="http://altivo.dreamwidth.org/" target="_blank">Altivo Overo</a></p>
<p>In silence she slinks   through the silver-dewed garden,<br />
Wandering walkways,   wishing for sustenance.<br />
Her three ring-tailed children   thirst in the home den<br />
For this matron of many,   a milk-bearing clan queen.</p>
<p>Soon will she show them,   in single file leading,<br />
Walking through woodland   to where there is food<br />
And water for washing   as will be required<br />
To live on their own   in lonely repose.</p>
<p>But now has she need   of nourishing foodstuff<br />
Herself, before comes here   the herald of dawn.<br />
Black eyes like buttons,   buried in face mask,<br />
Search not so well   for her sight is too poor.</p>
<p>All growing around her   too green are the berries,<br />
The sweet roots not ripened   or succulent yet.<br />
Thus takes she her tread   to the tall-hanging feeder<br />
For birds it’s intended   but better than none.</p>
<p>Alas! Though long-reaching   and laboring efforts<br />
She makes, it gains nothing.  A mumble, a hiss,<br />
And she turns to the trash cans,   a top that is loose.<br />
She knows it so well   as she nears it again.</p>
<p>Brief clatter. She’s in.   A complaint from a dog<br />
Afar wills it otherwise   but wonder, none comes<br />
To break up her feasting   in bones and waste matter<br />
Abandoned and left   to best care for her now.</p>
<p>The brood that is waiting   will be cared for also:<br />
No dearth of dark faces   to delve in the night.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Imprisoned Avian Dreams</span> by <a title="Corvus" href="http://www.furaffinity.net/user/corvus32346/" target="_blank">Corvus</a></p>
<p>My love, I chirp this song a slave<br />
Confined to sleep within this cage<br />
Yet you're the one that I so crave</p>
<p>I'm gone, but please don't fill with rage<br />
I'm here alone this restless night<br />
Confined to sleep within this cage</p>
<p>My feathers dream to soar in flight<br />
Yet lights go out as hope does too<br />
I'm here alone this restless night</p>
<p>I'd rest my beak right next to you<br />
We'd rise into the sky next day<br />
Yet lights go out as hope does too</p>
<p>When I return, we'll always play<br />
For when we meet then you will see<br />
We'd rise into the sky next day</p>
<p>I'm trapped for now and cannot flee<br />
My love, I chirp this song a slave<br />
For when we meet then you will see<br />
That you're the one that I so crave</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Siderosophia</span> by Steven Mando</p>
<p>Go down the oldest Woodland path,<br />
And if you walk for long,<br />
You’ll hear the Crow, the Owl, the Frog,<br />
And the Fox, who sings his song.</p>
<p>He sings to her, who falls behind<br />
His red and whizzing tail<br />
He sings because he’s so in love<br />
That he could sing for days.</p>
<p>“Come here, come here!” he tells her then<br />
“Come look at the night sky!<br />
The Moon is full, the clouds are gone<br />
And Stars shine bright on high!</p>
<p>“And if I were to see the Stars<br />
On lonely summer nights<br />
I'd count them all, to wait for when<br />
You'd come stay by my side</p>
<p>“And if we were to roam the Moon<br />
And you would float away<br />
I'd raise my paw, and grab your tail<br />
And hold you there for days</p>
<p>“And if I were to walk the Sun<br />
And burn off all my fur<br />
I know, I know, deep in my heart,<br />
You'd lend me yours for sure</p>
<p>“And if, on cold and endless nights<br />
I'd fall off into space<br />
You'd wait for me, my dearest love<br />
You'd wait for days and days.”</p>
<p>She sighed, and watched with empty eyes<br />
The one who thought he was loved<br />
She shook her head, and turned her tail<br />
And swiftly, she was gone.</p>
<p>“No sweat, no sweat,” the Fox would say.<br />
“Tomorrow's a new day<br />
We'll meet again, I know, my love<br />
And for that I will pray!”</p>
<p>No words on Earth will ever fill<br />
The large heart of a Fool.<br />
But if he's happy<br />
let him be.<br />
Real<br />
life<br />
can be<br />
quite<br />
cruel.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tricky Fox</span> by Mut</p>
<p>Tricky fox is quickly running.<br />
Sleepy dog is idly sunning.<br />
Fox in henhouse, feathers fly.<br />
Bird in mouth and gleam in eye.<br />
Dog left staring, jaws agape,<br />
As hungry fox makes his escape.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">never invite stray dogs into your home</span> by <a title="Buck Riley" href="http://huskyindenial.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Buck Riley</a></p>
<p>where were we, Love, 'ere<br />
we were were-<br />
wolves, weavingwoven throughinto the night<br />
sky, drinking the moon<br />
light heavy like wine<br />
(but why why why?)</p>
<p>You knew the (biblical) scents of a she(e)p<br />
he(a)rd the swooning swaying crooning<br />
of ani-mals of moon of dark of shadow<br />
and (what?) of us.</p>
<p>and what (of us)?</p>
<p>a husband? no husband<br />
ry is not your style<br />
you prefer(RED) the wild and me<br />
? I was - would be - wont to stay staid<br />
but you stayed (,) a stray (,) and lead (past present<br />
always present) me a-stray.</p>
<p>you taught me how(l)<br />
and I learned (became) HOWL</p>
<p>and howl and how<br />
to be reckless. no plastic<br />
on the paisley couch, coach<br />
ed in moonspeak and ani-mal-<br />
content. you showed me</p>
<p>the way (my) ripe apples fall in<br />
Autumn the smell of (cheap) leather in the<br />
Summer the taste of dead (graveyard) dirt in the<br />
Spring when the moon sighs</p>
<p>and sighs and sighs and sighs<br />
O!</p>
<p>but what of us?</p>
<p>Love, we were are RECKless,<br />
and I, Love, I am a wRECK<br />
(un)less I reek<br />
of wreaths of wildflowers, Love.<br />
of stigma of stamen of sweat, Love, but<br />
no Love! for steeple and stature and staid<br />
Love, you cannot stay (how) you are<br />
a stray, Love, you cannot stay a-stray.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">True to You, Oh My Darling, in my Fashion</span> by <a title="J/K Perique" href="https://www.weasyl.com/~peri" target="_blank">J/K Perique</a></p>
<p>I saw you rush away from Disney that day<br />
You said it was just a Magicked Kingdom<br />
Ceci n'est pas pour les autres quand nous</p>
<p>But by our byes they let us sit there<br />
And wear our special hats<br />
Though we both were Down and Out<br />
Les enfants, magnifique, symphonique, mais ne sont pas terribles.</p>
<p>We should've seen you in a millicent<br />
But your ship called<br />
And you beamed up<br />
To another port of call</p>
<p>We weren't lost then either<br />
Your guild is large, after all<br />
But the new navigator had different eyes<br />
Still blue, but full of fish and spice<br />
Et on y va, mais c'était pas la même chose</p>
<p>We still called him Terry<br />
In your honor, of course<br />
But he preferred Bison and Banks<br />
So we knew they could not stay<br />
Our Culture must change<br />
For even otters slip away</p>
<p>It was smooth sailing with the Bison<br />
But we still missed you<br />
So we named the next crewman Hatchette<br />
Since she was so cute<br />
Your type of gal, 知ってるの<br />
But espacés a froid dans l'avion</p>
<p>So when we huddled for warmth<br />
We learned it was a better name than we thought<br />
The symmetry may never be broken<br />
For our WELL is a circle, and a pool</p>
<p>But I still remember the fires we started<br />
Dans le monde du les autres<br />
Et je n'ai pas froid<br />
From the memories and the letters</p>
<p>よく読ない<br />
でもこの飲みは<br />
あの時へ</p>

<p>Black, brown, white tortie.<br />
Adopted from Feline Friends.<br />
Two empty nesters<br />

the furry queen of the house.</p>

<p>In the winter of Twenty-Ten,<br />
It was time for Further Confusion again.<br />
In Sillycon Valley,<br />
I went to a big furry rally.</p>
<p>Yes, those wild Furry fans<br />
put together great plans.<br />
They found a nice new hotel<br />
For they knew very well<br />
That thousands would attend<br />
And have fun till the end.</p>
<p>On the Twenty-First of Jan-u-ary,<br />
They traveled by cars, planes, trains, and maybe even a ferry.<br />
To the Fairmont Hotel San Jose,<br />
They all found their way.<br />
When the hotel doors opened and hundreds rushed in,<br />
We called out, "We're here! Let the Gold Rush begin!"</p>
<p>I met online friends, whom I'd not seen before,<br />
I looked all around and found even more.<br />
A friendly Rat from Brisbane,<br />
And a Red Deer from England.<br />
I met a rabbit for coffee,<br />
At a quarter to three.</p>
<p>The Fursuit Parade was a fire-hose of Fur!<br />
Hundreds came marching down the corridur.<br />
I saw BeastCub and Donkey<br />
OzRoo and Yippee Coyote.<br />
A tall white snow-beast from Star Wars, oh my heck,<br />
and a quadruped Targ from Star Trek.<br />
Such a huge variety,<br />
And amazing awesome creativity.</p>
<p>Workshops and panels for teaching,<br />
About writing, art and fursuiting.<br />
Art shows and auctions to show, buy and sell,<br />
Dealer's Den sales were quite good, I could tell.<br />
Masquerade, CritterOlympics and Furry Night Live,<br />
I cheered, I applauded, I laughed 'til I cried.</p>
<p>Too soon Monday came and away home I flew,<br />
FC Twenty-Ten,  I hope I never forget you.</p>

<p>Sex Thing or What by <a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/user/leif/">Leif the Otter</a></p>
<p>“Is it a sex thing, or what?”</p>
<p>The words linger in a void<br />
divided by the clicks of Mom's turn signal.<br />
I can't place finger nor paw on a wholly true answer</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>I want to know who's asking.</p>
<p>Is it the woman I would check behind my shoulders for?</p>
<p>Or the woman who signed notes "Mama Wolf,"<br />
when she learned her teenage son was a bit weird?</p>
<p>“I mean… it’s… <i>kinky</i>…”</p>
<p>I'm sure she wants to know who's answering.</p>
<p>Her little boy?</p>
<p>Her wolf pup?<br />
A pervert?</p>
<p>The silver Jeep hums around the corner<br />
as I struggle to find the right words.</p>
<p>“You even had a collar­­­ is it BDSM? ...Well?”</p>
<p>She breaks her eyes from the road,<br />
and I’m glad it’s dark out.</p>
<p>It hides the shame on my face.<br />
Hides it better than I could ever hide<br />
my fuzzy little secret.</p>
<p>“Kinda… the fandom’s reputation<br />
isn’t entirely unfounded...”</p>
<p>Silence. Every muscle tenses,<br />
as if I could jump out of all this,</p>
<p>this conversation,<br />
this Jeep,<br />
this world</p>
<p>I watch the road, in case she can’t.<br />
My eyes, blue like hers, begin to itch.<br />
Sensitive.</p>
<p>“But… I’ve made a lot of friends.”</p>
<p>My breath cuts the engine’s drone,<br />
and a smile tugs at my muzzle.<br />
My ears perk up,</p>
<p>“And it’s fun.”</p>
<p>I risk a glance her way,<br />
and meet skepticism in her raised brow.</p>
<p>Skepticism… and a smile.</p>
<p>“Just be safe. Safe and happy.”</p>
<p>Our destination brakes any further response,<br />
and parked, we sit for a few seconds,<br />
letting our few words wash over us.</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>Human<br />
Pervert<br />
Wolf<br />
Son</p>
<p>I am all of these.<br />
“Sex thing” or not.</p>
<p>Safe<br />
Happy</p>
