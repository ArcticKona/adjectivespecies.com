<p>It would be silly for a meta-furry blog to post a con report, and that's not quite what we're going to do here, but we would like to note that [adjective][species] was at Further Confusion 2012 (still is, technically) as Fan Media, and we had a blast! While there, we handed out surveys, cards, and "I &hearts; RandomWolf" stickers, lined up some future interviews, and spent a good deal of time talking to and observing our fellow furries.</p>
<p>In the future, we would also like to conduct some interviews while at the con (we brought a camcorder this year, but forgot to really do anything with it), and have more people helping to conduct the survey. However, we are also open to suggestions - what would you like to see from us at conventions? What other conventions would you like to see us visit? Is there any convention specific content that you would like to see us produce? Let us know what you think in the comments and we'll definitely take it into consideration!</p>
<p>Keep being awesome, folks!</p>
