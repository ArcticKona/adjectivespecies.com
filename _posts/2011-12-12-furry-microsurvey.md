<p>I know, I know, two asides in a row; I've been trying to keep them to a minimum.  However, I'd just like to note that, if you've taken the 2011 Furry Survey (or even if you haven't - and why not, huh!?), there is an <a href="http://klisoura.com/microsurvey20111205.php" target="_blank">additional microsurvey</a> of psychographic information available that could provide some very useful insights for us, which we can pass on to you!  Head on over and fill it out!</p>
