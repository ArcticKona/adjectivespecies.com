<p class="p1">Hey there, folks!  Some issues with the way that we license our works from authors came up recently, and I figured it was probably about time that we make all of that as clear as we can!</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everything on the [adjective][species] site, including its sub-sites such as the visualizations and, to a lesser extent, polls, is licensed from the author. All we do is ask the author for the rights to post their content under a certain license. They can choose not to accept that license and opt for something more or less restrictive if they want, but so far, that’s not been an issue. The license that we use is called the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> license. This is a very liberal license that allows work to be shared freely on the internet. The CC license comes with a few different ‘clauses’ that can be added on to modify the terms of the license. In our case, we use the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 version</a> (we're currently looking into upgrading to the 4.0 version).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What does this mean?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This means that anyone – including you, and including syndicators, such as Flayrah, who syndicates our articles through RSS – is free to take the articles on our site and share them, remix them, use them for your own purposes! Totally free. We make no money off anything at [a][s], so we’re not about to start clamping down for any reason.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So what does the BY-NC-SA stand for? </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="s1">The BY portion means that you can repost or remix any of our content, so long as you attribute it back to us.<br />
</span></li>
<li>NC stands for Non-Commercial. That means that you can share, mash up, or use any of our content, so long as you aren’t making a profit on it. We want our articles to be free for anyone, inside the fandom or out, to read. This means not posting anything behind a paywall.</li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">SA stands for Share-Alike. What the Share-Alike clause means is that you can share our content however you like, EXCEPT that it must be licensed under the same CC BY-NC-SA license, which just means putting that somewhere around the article.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, to reiterate, you may post anything we license out on the web, so long as you</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Credit the author (or, failing that, [adjective][species])</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Release it for free</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Put “This article released under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 3.0 license” somewhere, such as at the bottom of the article or after the attribution.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I do apologize for the complexities of licensing, but [adjective][species], as a business, does bear some of the legal, not to mention ethical, burden of ensuring that our writers are fairly recognized as fantastic contributors to the furry subculture, and so we really do try to make sure that that is the case.  If you have any additional comments, y</span><span class="s1">ou can feel free to respond here, or, if ever you want, email me at <a href="mailto:makyo@adjectivespecies.com"><span class="s2">makyo@adjectivespecies.com</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All my best,</span></p>
