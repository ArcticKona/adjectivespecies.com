<p>It was suggested by a few folks that it would be good to do a semi-regular feature on some of the wonderful art that gets lost in the torrent of furry porn (which certainly has its place in our fandom).  For this post, we'll be taking a look at <a href="http://furaffinity.net/user/chrisgoodwin" target="_blank">Chris Goodwin on FA</a>, who has been posting small drawings and paintings to his "Overheard" series for a while now.</p>

<figure id="attachment_220" style="float: center" width="227" caption="Overheard - No, it&#39;s fine..."><a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/view/6721208/"><img class="size-full wp-image-220" title="Overheard - No, it's fine..." src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1319349269.half_.chrisgoodwin_noitsfine.jpg" alt="Overheard - No, it's fine..." width="227" height="300" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Taking overheard snippets of conversations and turning them into short two- or three-panel cartoons, Goodwin has created several small slice-of-life images, humorous and touching both.  While they contain anthropomorphic animals, these images aren't strictly <em>Just Furry</em>, but represent conversations anyone could imagine themselves having or hearing out in the world at large.</p>
<figure id="attachment_221" style="float: center" width="224" caption="Overheard - I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s that cold"><a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/view/6857440/"><img class="size-full wp-image-221" title="Overheard - I just don't think it's that cold" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1321327481.half_.chrisgoodwin_6346503128_53f24cfa11_b.jpg" width="224" height="300" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm really no art writer, but one of the most striking and beautiful things about these images is the way each of the panels are tied together, both stylistically with their thin, sketchy lines, and through the use of a dominant color scheme.</p>
<figure id="attachment_222" style="float: center" width="215" caption="Overheard - I will speak with you when you are not"><a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/view/6967460/"><img class="size-full wp-image-222" title="Overheard - I will speak with you when you are not" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1322935910.half_.chrisgoodwin_6447781353_cddd50c759_b.jpg" width="215" height="300" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Each of these comics can be read on its own, there is no arc, of course, but taking them all in one right after another gives the impression of travelling through Boston on a cold-ish day, stopping by a coffee shop on the way to the station.</p>
<figure id="attachment_223" style="float: center" width="213" caption="Overheard - Well, maybe it&#39;s just a phase"><a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/view/7069847/"><img class="size-full wp-image-223" title="Overheard - Well, maybe it's just a phase" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1324436087.half_.chrisgoodwin_phasefa.jpg" width="213" height="300" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>The composition and art is beautiful, the colors captivating, and the subject matter often touching or heart-breaking.  Please, check out this <a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/view/5898851" target="_blank">awesome set</a> on FA.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you have or have found some interesting, out-of-the-ordinary art and would like to have it featured here, please <a href="mailto:submit@adjectivespecies.com" target="_blank">let us know</a>, and we'll see about creating a small write-up here.  The only guidelines are that it should be unique in some way, different from the flood of porn that seems to take up most of the art sites out there; and that it should be either a set of images or a larger work, such as a graphic novel or comic.</p>
