<p>There's all sorts of things that would have to be different about the world around us, were it a truly furry world.  These can be as simple as structuring chairs differently, or as complicated as equal rights for all species in a multi-species setting.  Lets collect a bunch of them here, just for funsies!  I've divided the list up into species-specific and non species-specific issues, with sub-categories in the species-specific category.  Inspired by <a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/view/4725473/" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>

<h2>Species specific</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Snakes, Nagas, and the like</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stairs could pose quite an issue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Giraffes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Doorways could prove to be awkward, and building every building to accommodate might be impractical</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Elephants</strong>
<ul>
<li>As with Giraffes, buildings would need to be specially designed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Avians</strong>
<ul>
<li>Steps would get awkward</li>
<li>Possible entrances on multiple levels, and perches within a building</li>
<li>Air-traffic regulations are bad enough, but add in avians flying about...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bats</strong>
<ul>
<li>How do shirts work?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Not species-specific</h2>
<ul>
<li>Motorcycles and convertibles could cause some...<a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/112148590111521465538/albums/5685207500306194321/5685207500151937026" target="_blank">facial discomfort</a>.</li>
<li>Speaking of, motorcycles, bicycles and the like - would have to come up with a way to keep fur or entire tails from getting trapped in the chain!</li>
<li>Eating gummi worms</li>
<li>"Being a professional chef, my career would be over. Hair, on ALL OF THE THINGS! I'd have to shave my hands and arms to work."</li>
<li>"More food for thought (literally): eating. Most furries are canine; ripping/tearing eating, rather than mashing as human."</li>
<li>"Another big problem: I'd be expected to be dressed, probably to human standards, so I'd be too warm."</li>
<li>Bathing would be a pain - so anything that involves getting dirty</li>
<li>Cups could be a real pain (see <a href="http://www.adjectivespecies.com/2011/12/17/open-post-never-think-about/#comment-57">comment</a>)</li>
<li>Differences in senses could cause awkwardness or even strife (see <a href="http://www.adjectivespecies.com/2011/12/17/open-post-never-think-about/#comment-57">comment</a>)</li>
<li>The tricky question of carnivores versus herbivores. (see <a href="http://www.adjectivespecies.com/2011/12/17/open-post-never-think-about/#comment-57">comment</a>)</li>
<li>Workplace discrimination based on species attributes. (see <a href="http://www.adjectivespecies.com/2011/12/17/open-post-never-think-about/#comment-57">comment</a>)</li>
<li>Cleaning the drain.  Monthly.</li>
</ul>
