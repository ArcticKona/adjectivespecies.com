<p>I've been a semi-professional writer for many years now. I published my first short<br />
story in about 1999, and since then have written and published about twenty-<br />
two or twenty-three vaguely book-length thingies (I tend to write a much higher<br />
percentage of novellas than most authors, frequently sold to the public as shorter<br />
than standard books) plus I've lost count of how many shorts. While I mostly write<br />
furry and furry SF, I also do horror, non-furry SF, essays, fantasy and even good old<br />
conventional literary fiction. So I know the publishing industry a little, or at least I<br />
think I do.</p>
<p>Over the past year, I've achieved my first real landmark success in the <em>David</em><br />
<em>Birkenhead</em> books, in which a young slavebunny is manumitted and finds success<br />
in a future navy despite all the social roadblocks that lie in his way. Each book in<br />
the series is titled after the rank that David achieves during the course of the story,<br />
from <em>Ship's Boy</em> to <em>Admiral</em>. Currently my publisher and I are ecstatically selling<br />
well over a thousand copies a week. So far so good and yay for me, right? Maybe.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As I said, I've been dealing with the publishing industry—and through it, in theory<br />
at least, the wants and needs of book-buyers—for some time. Over and over again<br />
the "big guys" have rejected my stuff even though in my own opinion many of<br />
my previous works have been better than the Birkenheads. More often than not<br />
I got a rejection letter saying something like "Good work—you're writing at the<br />
professional level. But we don't publish talking animal stories." Then they'd add<br />
nitpicky comments about my personal style that usually were in direct contradiction<br />
to the nitpicks I received the time before. It was obvious that the "talking animals"<br />
were the real problem, especially for my serious furry SF stuff, even though the<br />
science involved wasn't just clearly justified in the work in question but was<br />
often the root of the theme and the driver of the plot. Without the talking animals,<br />
which in my case were usually rabbits, the book was nothing. And because my<br />
own best ideas most often are equally rooted in furry imagery, well… It was clear<br />
that something would have to give. I could either compromise my art to meet the<br />
unspoken "no furries allowed" rule at the big publishing houses—which their other<br />
comments made clear was what they really wanted—or I could be true to my muse<br />
and accept that I'd never do business with the mainstream book industry.</p>
<p>So I set out to beat the big publishers at their own game and sell furry fiction despite<br />
everything the closed-minded bastards could do to stop me. At this point I had<br />
written three multi-book series that I truly believed were of professional quality<br />
and could sell well if given the chance. (One of these three was the Birkenheads.)<br />
I sent one each to three small publishers (two of them furry-fandom based) and<br />
commenced hostilities against the mainstream. As of today, I can almost claim<br />
victory. The Birkenheads, as mentioned above, are currently selling at a rate well in<br />
excess of a thousand a week and, as I type this, all seven volumes are in the Amazon<br />
Kindle Science Fiction Top 100. Sure enough the other two series are now selling well too, though not at the same blistering rate. I can claim complete vindication and declare victory.</p>
<p>Almost.</p>
<p>There's still one major thing wrong, which I didn't anticipate and perhaps should’ve.<br />
While most of the reviews of the Birkenhead books are embarrassingly positive, a<br />
very significant minority of readers apparently are driven to the point of rending<br />
their clothing and gnashing their teeth when, about five pages or so into <em>Ship's</em><br />
<em>Boy</em>, they discover (having failed to read the book's "blurb", which would've<br />
warned them) that they've been reading a story told from the viewpoint of an<br />
uplifted rabbit (capital-R Rabbit, in the nomenclature of the series). Something<br />
about this is apparently hideously repulsive to them at the core identity level, to<br />
the point that in their reviews they do things like claim my parents must've been<br />
alcoholics. (No, I didn't make that one up.) Others state that this is proof that I know<br />
nothing of science—apparently ray guns and FTL travel are far more "scientific"<br />
than genetic engineering and species uplift. Some go so far as to call the work<br />
well-written, but say it's "impossible" for them to get into the character. One even<br />
suggested it'd be a good book if the protagonist had been an alien instead.</p>
<p>It's easier to relate to a complete alien than a Rabbit?</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong here. At this point I can gaze serenely upon such reviews and<br />
laugh all the way to the bank. I'm being well compensated for acting as a public<br />
target, and by far the majority of the comments are supportive and positive. I'm not<br />
after sympathy here. Rather, I'm seeking to understand something.</p>
<p>Why exactly is it that some readers react so strongly, even violently, to the idea of a<br />
serious story being told from the viewpoint of a Rabbit?</p>
<p>Usually in these columns I try to offer some sort of insight—possible answers to the<br />
questions I raise. This time, however, I find myself pretty much at a loss. All long-<br />
time furs recall an era when our fandom was seen as something sick and repulsive,<br />
and indeed this period may well not yet be over. For when I read the public Amazon<br />
reviews on <em>Ship's Boy</em> and to a lesser extent the later volumes of the series, I see<br />
the public's reaction to furry in microcosm. Mostly these reviews reflect open-<br />
minded support and people who like to have fun, yes. And bless them for it! But I<br />
also see a large minority who for reasons I literally cannot imagine instantly become<br />
totally unhinged at the idea of seeing the world through anthropomorphic eyes. If<br />
you read their comments, it's like they felt the need to ritually purify themselves<br />
by expressing immoderate outrage and indignation after exposure to such an<br />
unclean influence. Theirs is an attitude that cannot be reasoned with—it goes far<br />
deeper than that. The subject fascinates me; I think there's real knowledge to be<br />
gained about basic human nature if a way can be found to research the matter<br />
systematically.</p>
<p>And I hope this research someday is indeed actually done. Because only now, after<br />
declaring war on the mainstream publishers and then beating them in terms of sales<br />
do I realize that the real battle is only beginning. The one the publishers knew about<br />
all along, and were rejecting me over. And why shouldn't they? After all, it's not their<br />
fight. Why risk having their products plastered with negative reviews that resonate<br />
with John Q. Public despite their inherent irrationality?</p>
<p>The real fight, I've learned from all this, is the one that will someday allow everyone<br />
everywhere to understand that it's okay to experience the universe through<br />
whatever set of eyes they choose. Everything else is merely a subset of this larger<br />
battle, and it'll be more a matter of freeing people from themselves than anything<br />
else. Combat is only just beginning in earnest, and I'm not a young man anymore.<br />
I probably won't live to see the end of it. But by golly I mean to get my licks in<br />
regardless!</p>
