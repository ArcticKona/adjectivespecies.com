<p>Lets say you wind up with some spare time on the weekend or after work (or, hell, at work) and you're a little pent up.  If you want to have some fun on the Internet, there's a few simple guide-lines you can follow to find some... er... release.  It all depends on where you're looking.</p>

<h2>FurryMUCK</h2>
<p>Hang out around a bunch of people and single one person out.  After a while, the sexual tension will reach the breaking point and things will just happen in a whisper, right there in the WCotP or the Purple Nurple.  Who knows if it will happen again, and it may be awkward next time you inevitably run into them at FC, but hey, it was fun!</p>
<h2>SPR (SocioPolitical Ramifications MUCK)</h2>
<p>Don't. Instead, hang around for a while, and chances are good that what will happen is you'll run into someone, meet someone through them, chat for a while only semi in-character, then boom!  It'll happen!  It may take months to get to this point, but by then, you'll have a super friend and, potentially, a relationship.</p>
<h2>Tapestries</h2>
<p>Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.  Simply follow this flow chart:</p>

<h2>IRC</h2>
<p>Just start going, if everything's okay, the other person will go along with you.  Depending on the room, you can even do it in-channel.</p>
<p>Have any more suggestions?  Leave them in the comments.</p>
