<p>Hey folks!  We've gotten a few requests so far for comment reply notifications via e-mail.  I had originally thought that this was part of WordPress, but I suppose not.  I did, however, find a plugin that should help out with this.  When commenting, you will now see a check box, which, if checked, will tell the blog to send you an email whenever someone replies to your comment.  This is currently checked by default, so you will have to un-check it if you do not wish to receive emails of replies.  This is configurable, and depending on feedback, I can change it in the future.  I hope this helps with discussion on the site!</p>
<p>Thanks :o)</p>
