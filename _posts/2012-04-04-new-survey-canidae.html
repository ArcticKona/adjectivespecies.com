<p>Hey, all you wolves, dogs, foxes, and other assorted wonderful canids!  We'd like to see how the family <em>canidae</em> breaks down in terms of representation within the fandom!  Head on over to <a href="http://survey.adjectivespecies.com/canidae/" target="_blank">take the survey</a>, and we'll bring up a visualization of responses once we get enough.  The survey is only a single question, so it should be fairly quick.</p>
<p>Thanks, folks :o)</p>
