<p>We were fortunate enough to have the opportunity to present a panel this year at Rocky Mountain Fur Con, and let me tell you, it was an absolute blast being able to talk about exploring the fandom to a standing-room-only crowd (even if we did have the Worst Projector).  While much of the information involved in the panel itself has already been covered here, the most fun part of the session was the discussion that followed.  There are just so many insightful furries out there, and it was excellent having <a href="http://www.adjectivespecies.com/author/klisoura/">Klisoura</a>, <a href="http://www.adjectivespecies.com/author/zik/">Zik</a>, and <a href="http://www.adjectivespecies.com/author/kyell/">Kyell</a> there as well.</p>
<p>We also had the chance to record, so after the cut are two videos: one of the panel portion and one of the discussion portion.  You'll have to forgive my nervousness, of course, but I do hope you enjoy the panel as much as I enjoyed participating.</p>
