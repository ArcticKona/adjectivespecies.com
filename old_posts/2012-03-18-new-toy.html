<p>Hey!  We know furries are awesome.  Super awesome.  That's a big part of why we're furries, too.  We love writing about the fandom of which we are a part.  In order to help further much of this discussion, we've added a new toy to [a][s]: <a href="http://forums.adjectivespecies.com" target="_blank">forums</a>.  Now we can open the discussion of furry up all the further.</p>
<p>Also, and here's the part I'm particularly excited about, <a href="http://forums.adjectivespecies.com/viewforum.php?f=7" target="_blank">one of these forums</a> will be used for letting everyone contribute to the site by writing collaborative articles.  I know I'm an enormous dork, writing furry essays every week, so for those of you less dorky than I, feel free to chip in on a collaboration and get some of your ideas published here on the site.  I know this is all a bit of an experiment, but I have high hopes: I know I see at least one journal entry on FA per week that would make a good topic for a post, so I know you guys would be good at this!</p>
<p>Have fun, play nice, keep being awesome :o)</p>
