<p>Have you ever needed to get out of a scene you didn't actually want to be in?  Started playing around with someone and you didn't really want to?  Collected here for your reference are a few options that have been used before - sometimes legitimately, promise! - to get out of scenes.</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li><em>"God dammit, I have to go get my roommate, he got a flat tire..."</em> - Legitimate: my roommate had a shit car that had tires go out one by one in a circle around the car as he would replace one at a time.</li>
<li><em>"Oh, shit, neighbors lit their house on fire with Christmas lights!"</em> - Semi-legitimate: my neighbors are pretty terrible people, and they did melt a strand of lights one year.</li>
<li><em>"Ah, I have to go watch 24 now."</em> - Legitimate: I had this one used on me.  Fair enough, I suppose...</li>
<li><em>"Damn, brother interrupted me, sorry!"</em> - Not legitimate: I'm an only child.</li>
<li><em>"Sorry, feeling kinda sick..."</em> - Both: really depends on the situation.  I've gotten into a scene I really shouldn't have while sick before more than once.</li>
<li><em>"I'm super tired/have to get up early/have work/have school and need to get going, sorry."</em> Legitimate: it's a valid reason.</li>
<li><em>"I came too soon..."</em> - Legitimate: understandable.  However, I've never seen this one in the wild.</li>
</ul>
<div>Let us know if you happen across anymore!</div>
