<p>Welcome to The Third [adjective][species] Poetry Collection! Each year, for the past few years, we have collected some poetry from those within the fandom centered around a loose theme. This year's theme was **comunity and belonging**. Below are the submissions we received in no particular order (other than the fact that the first made Makyo cry on the plane).</p>
<p>The furry subculture is full of unbelievable talent, and it is our pleasure to showcase poetry from those who make up the fandom.<!-- more --></p>
<h2>"Quigley Napoleon Underfoot" by Jazmine Bellamy</h2>
<p>That little wet nose with the short legs &amp; the crooked tail didn’t know<br />
How broken the family he was becoming a part of was</p>
<p>All he knew was he was leaving yet another place behind<br />
Another car ride to another place</p>
<p>Old Maggie finally had the chance &amp; sat on him<br />
Big Red &amp; Bigger Jed were thrilled to see him go</p>
<p>He noticed off the bat<br />
Just how quiet &amp; sad his new mommy was</p>
<p>How much his new daddy didn’t seem to care<br />
Past saying that getting him was a mistake</p>
<p>A year or many dog years later<br />
He was back in that house they’d picked him up from</p>
<p>Big Red wasn’t there anymore<br />
Old Maggie was older still</p>
<p>But a new friend was exciting<br />
A Bassedor</p>
<p>So ungraceful<br />
His new sister Grace</p>
<p>His mommy loved on them both so much<br />
She was still sad</p>
<p>Some days more than others<br />
But they all sat in the sun in the yard for hours</p>
<p>The years rolled by<br />
Mommy was up and down and all around</p>
<p>One day<br />
Mommy was gone</p>
<p>A whole week gone she was<br />
Daddy and his other girly stayed though</p>
<p>When mommy came home she was still scared but not as sad it seemed<br />
Suddenly they were packing again</p>
<p>Everything in boxes and garbage bags<br />
A new bed</p>
<p>Just the three of them<br />
Yet the family wasn’t broken anymore</p>
<p>He was starting to feel old<br />
As the years slowly shuffled past</p>
<p>Mommy brought home someone new<br />
Patient &amp; calm &amp; kind</p>
<p>Who rubbed his ears just right<br />
Scratched his back so good</p>
<p>His new daddy loved all of them<br />
The family grew again</p>
<p>New daddy bought them all a bigger bed<br />
But he still wanted to sleep right between them at night</p>
<p>This was the forever family he signed up for<br />
When he left that foster home way back when.</p>
<h2>"Fuzzed Gallery" by <a href="https://twitter.com/zoejtanner">Z. Tanner</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes people can only see<br />
myself as a monstrosity<br />
They spare no thought nor sympathy<br />
no quarter given unto me<br />
in spite of all this tragedy<br />
that I have found a family!<br />
Inside of the menagerie<br />
They accept all identities<br />
Genders and sexualities<br />
with the words of simply be<br />
Beauty paired with simplicity<br />
of implicit animality<br />
a strike against the world's cruelty<br />
Have I found such camaraderie<br />
And this is where I becomes we.<br />
So come join me and he and she,<br />
Lots of room in this gallery<br />
So with a kind heart and some glee<br />
Welcome to our community.</p>
<h2>"Color Fur Power" by <a href="http://www.adjectivespecies.com/author/shiningriver/">Shining River</a></h2>
<p>Color Fur Power is<br />
The power in the fibers<br />
And those fibers come together.<br />
In our superfurry bodies,<br />
Our paws, arms, and faces.</p>
<p>Put on your head!<br />
Yeah, put on your head!<br />
Join our dancing mass of colors<br />
In more than a parade,<br />
More than a masquerade.<br />
'Cuz this time it's for real.</p>
<p>Color Fur Power<br />
Is our fierce furful love,<br />
Our fierce furful hope,<br />
Our fierce furful joy<br />
Will shake the earth.<br />
We shake the earth.<br />
Until a stubborn monument falls,<br />
And an ancient flag of black and white and red</p>
<p>Is<br />
No<br />
More.</p>
<p>We write for justice,<br />
Speak for freedom.<br />
Solidarity<br />
For the fur family.<br />
To dance around the flagpole<br />
And the stubborn monument<br />
And sing a freedom song.<br />
We shake the earth.</p>
<p>With the blessing of the Sun,<br />
And the blessing of the Moon,<br />
Color Fur Power flows within us<br />
Color Fur Power flows from us.<br />
And the stubborn monument gives way.<br />
The flagpole falls and the flag<br />
Of black and white and red tears loose.<br />
It's away,<br />
away,<br />
away down.<br />
On to the ashes<br />
of history.</p>
<h2>"Call to Change" by <a href="https://twitter.com/zoejtanner">Z. Tanner</a></h2>
<p>This is our community<br />
It belongs to you and me<br />
We can make this place great<br />
If we can just stomp out hate.</p>
<p>Cannot block this silent roar<br />
The Poisoned hounds have taken root.<br />
But we can heal this open sore.<br />
If we can give them all the boot</p>
<p>Is not the time to tolerate<br />
Nor is the time to anticipate<br />
Now's the time to stand and act<br />
That's not opinion that is fact</p>
<p>So Fuzzed friends and family<br />
Which side is it gonna be?</p>
<h2>"Thoughts From a Ewe in Late Autumn" by Jazmine Bellamy</h2>
<p>“How strange”<br />
She thought<br />
As she watched the imperfect v’s overhead<br />
This time headed south</p>
<p>“They should just find a place and be happy”<br />
She shook her wooly head and lowered it<br />
Back to the hay left out by the farmer</p>
<p>“My own sisters and I enjoy all that is here”<br />
She mused as the shepherd dog lazed nearby<br />
Eyeing all of his flock peaceful on the ground</p>
<p>“Even the Collie is one of us anymore”<br />
She munched happily at the realization<br />
Sure he wouldn’t appreciate it as much but still be amused</p>
<h2>"Progress and Change" by <a href="http://twitter.com/KynaStonepaw">Z. Tanner</a></h2>
<p>We stand tall on<br />
those that came before.<br />
Refining our flaws<br />
Carried to these shores</p>
<p>Breaking down these<br />
Zoo walls bars and cages.<br />
Reaching up to the stars<br />
We be thoughtful sages.</p>
<p>Learn from our history<br />
and one another<br />
These animals we be<br />
Are welcome as brother</p>
<p>And march on from<br />
the dark of our past<br />
Beasts who have learned<br />
To make all this Last</p>
<p>United Together<br />
Us Animals be<br />
I'm glad to be here<br />
With you and with me.</p>
<p>Continue with me,<br />
In our diversity.</p>
<h2>"Otters of the Northwest" by Jazmine Bellamy</h2>
<p>The surface of the water breaks<br />
A spray of droplets<br />
Followed by happy chuffing<br />
Another dive<br />
Fur sleek<br />
Spirals and rolls<br />
The chill of the underwater world barely noticed<br />
Dancing<br />
Elegant and free at the same time<br />
Pure ecstasy<br />
Clown princesses and princes of their aquatic realms<br />
Trickster darlings<br />
But that beautiful dance<br />
Oh to be able to move like they do<br />
Dancing in beams of light that break between the currents<br />
Precious moments of ephemeral grace</p>
<h2>"Place called Fandom" by <a href="https://twitter.com/zoejtanner">Z. Tanner</a></h2>
<p>This place called fandom<br />
is where I have found me<br />
Yeah this place called fandom<br />
is where I found me.<br />
It gave me a place to explore<br />
and room to be free</p>
<p>It's such a wild place to be<br />
friends encourage growth and change<br />
Such a wild place to be<br />
my friends help me grow and change<br />
With radical inclusive love<br />
The world we will rearrange</p>
<p>I am glad that I am here<br />
with all expression to just be.<br />
Oh so glad that I am here<br />
And free to express all that be.</p>
<p>I am grateful that you are here,<br />
We together make furry.</p>
<h2>"Midnight or so" by <a href="https://spectral-k.tumblr.com">Tyler Parsons</a></h2>
<p>The winds awaken from their dead sleep,<br />
on one of those nights around midnight or so.<br />
It’s right about that time of night,<br />
that I find myself wandering alone.</p>
<p>“You’d think by now I’d have learned to cope,”<br />
I sigh to nobody passing by,<br />
as I pull my coat in closer,<br />
cuddling a ghost with all my might.</p>
<p>I remember saying something like<br />
“You are the only one who understands me,”<br />
but the gentle breeze upon my face<br />
is my only hope for a reply.</p>
<p>Eventually, when my pilgrimage<br />
has laid time to rest<br />
and my skin feels just a bit too tight,<br />
I come across wherever I was headed all this time:</p>
<p>this desolate freeway overpass<br />
between the suburbs and the forest,<br />
where balls of light dart<br />
towards the endless darkness.</p>
<p>Then, I felt the wind pick up<br />
and force me against the railing,<br />
like the world had stopped moving<br />
but the air continued past.</p>
<p>The trees bowed, the clouds scattered,<br />
a golden moon blazed down from a clear sky,<br />
and somewhere deep down inside,<br />
something was aching to come out.</p>
<p>AROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>
<p>I cover my mouth as I stumble into the road<br />
struggling to steady myself<br />
watching the world roll around inside my head.<br />
what on earth had come over me?</p>
<p>As the wind begins to clear<br />
and the world shifts back into place,<br />
I start to hear a familiar sound<br />
coming somewhere from the town.</p>
<p>It started slow, a faint murmur<br />
from the depths of the earth, rising<br />
up to the rooftops, past the trees<br />
into the swirling sky</p>
<p>From all over the city, the choir sings,<br />
surrounding me with their music.<br />
A howl—a million howls<br />
ringing out through the sky;</p>
<p>and I with my silence,<br />
begging to be released,<br />
and the last of my will<br />
floating away in the night…</p>
<p>So I did the only thing<br />
I could ever do:<br />
I let myself howl<br />
and cared not who or what heard.</p>
<p>I have found them.<br />
They have found me.</p>
<h2>"Forgiveness" by <a href="https://twitter.com/zoejtanner">Z. Tanner</a></h2>
<p>I was once called to serve among you<br />
Proud as a lion I stood.<br />
Tried to hear complaints all through,<br />
Trying so hard to be good.</p>
<p>But yet like many I've stumbled<br />
in fear I made a call<br />
From that I didn't fumble,<br />
What I did was fall.</p>
<p>Felt like I was a broken cat<br />
to far gone to redeem,<br />
You all told me it's not like that<br />
That it wasn't what it seems</p>
<p>I now still walk among you<br />
As we are all friends true.</p>
<h2>"Meaning and Self" by <a href="https://adjectivespecies.com/author/makyo/">Makyo</a></h2>
<p>There's some duality between sources of meaning,<br />
Between the types of stories we use to back identity.<br />
It's not quite good &amp; bad or light &amp; dark,<br />
Though I'm not yet sure just how to define it.</p>
<p>Dad used to punish the dogs<br />
by locking then in the basement.<br />
If he was really mad,<br />
he'd toss then down there by the scruff.</p>
<p>Mom moved me &amp; her dogs to a new house —<br />
moved us three days early during the divorce.<br />
Her dog punched my ex stepdad in the crotch the night before,<br />
the nut-shot to end all nut-shots, &amp; our time there.</p>
<p>Few things make me feel as deeply about life as parenthood,<br />
even if it's just me caring for my dogs.<br />
Some reminders of that are intense enough to be raw, painful,<br />
salt in the wounds of mortality, maybe, or the ache of maternal love.</p>
<p>The meaning behind the story of me &amp; my dogs<br />
comes with a story of its own, or maybe several.<br />
It's bound up in stories to come,<br />
&amp; these stories nest infinitely deep.</p>
<p>Remembering that &amp; shaping that,<br />
It's a part of making the meaning in my life.<br />
This isn't better against worse,<br />
it's not mom against dad.</p>
<p>It's not a dichotomy at all, really,<br />
now that I think about it.<br />
It's something subtler, comfortably complex, a topic of its own.<br />
I guess it's just meaning &amp; self.</p>
<h2>"A Rhyme" by <a href="https://twitter.com/zoejtanner">Z. Tanner</a></h2>
<p>Birds of a feather<br />
all chant together<br />
cats in our clowders<br />
come on now get louder<br />
you ferrets in business<br />
Ya'll already got this<br />
Dogs in your packs<br />
we've all got your backs<br />
Through this diversity<br />
we all achieve unity<br />
Join us and come in<br />
There's warmth here within.</p>
