<p>This is just a reminder that [adjective][species] will be hosting a panel at <a href="http://www.rockymountainfurcon.org/" target="_blank">Rocky Mountain Fur Con</a> this year!  Makyo, Klisoura, and Zik will be there to talk about exploring the fandom through data and introspection.  Please feel free to join us in Executive B on Saturday at 11AM!  For those not able to make it, we will be aiming to record the talk portion of the panel; if everything goes well, we'll post it here.</p>
