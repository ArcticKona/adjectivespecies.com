<p>It's been a long time since we've done any open posts here at [adjective][species].  A lot of this is due to the sheer amount of personal stuff that's been going on, but also, it's been hard to think up any good topics!  It would be nice to try something new with this one.  I've <a title="Makyo’s Kaddish" href="http://www.adjectivespecies.com/2012/03/21/makyos-kaddish/">talked before</a> about how I got into the fandom - finding yerf, getting out of hand with it in high school, then calming down later on.  We're interested in the variety of stories from other people, though!  What got you into anthropomorphized animals?  What got you into the furry subculture?  Heck, how did you find this website?  Tell us about all of your beginnings!</p>

<p><strong>N.B.</strong> Rather than modifying the post with all the responses, since that would mean mostly copy/pasting what commentors provide, I'll leave the comments mostly in place, unless I receive comments form Google+, Twitter, or FA!</p>
